<p>Hi! I am Ziaurrahman Athaya, I am 17 years old in className 12 majoring in Vocational High School
            Computer and Network Engineering (TKJ). At first I was involved in the world
            programming when I was in grade 1 junior high school where I was still learning basic HTML,
            then I switched to the Python programming language which is still only CLI and moved to the Framework
            Python is Django. After getting to know the Django Framework well, I moved again to the Java programming language
            day by day I study Java and learn its Framework which is Spring boot which is Spring boot
            My favorite framework so far, and now when I made this portfolio I was confronted by it
            Field Work Practices (PKL) which are required to learn Javascript and its Framework, namely ReactJs, NestJs, and NodeJs.
          </p>
